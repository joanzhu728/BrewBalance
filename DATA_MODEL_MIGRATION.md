# Data Model Migration Plan

Purpose

- Describe current data model and runtime behavior.
- Define desired state to enforce immutable past budgets.
- Provide concrete migration steps, data model changes, and implementation tasks.

Current State

- Settings (`Settings`) and entries (`Entry[]`) persisted in `localStorage` via keys in `constants.ts`.
- `calculateStats(settings, entries, targetDate?)` in `utils/financeHelpers.ts` derives daily `baseBudget` and rollovers directly from the live `settings` when run.
- `DailyStats` does not persist applied budget/rollover values; no transaction log or per-day snapshots exist.
- `App.tsx` recomputes `statsMap` for a long future horizon whenever `settings` or `entries` change, so changing `settings` today mutates computed past `DailyStats`.

Desired State

- Historical (past) dates — any date strictly before local `today` — are immutable: their applied base budget, rollover, and derived `DailyStats` must not change when `settings` are edited.
- `today` and future dates reflect current settings.
- Provide an auditable source-of-truth for the applied per-day budgets and rollovers used to compute historical balances.

High-level approach

Immutable Transaction Log (ledger) — recommended

- Maintain an append-only transaction log; every state change is a transaction (user settings edits, system-generated daily budget creation, entries, rollovers, challenge events).
- Derive state (settings and per-day budgets) by replaying transactions up to a given date; persist periodic checkpoints (snapshots) to avoid replay cost.
- Strong auditability and extensibility (undo/redo, server sync). Larger implementation scope and migration complexity compared to a simple snapshot approach, but provides a robust long-term foundation.

Data model changes

- Define a `Transaction` model in `types.ts` and a `TransactionType` enum. Example transactions: `ENTRY_ADDED`, `SETTINGS_UPDATED`, `DAILY_BUDGET_CREATED`, `CUSTOM_ROLLOVER_SET`, `CHALLENGE_CREATED`, `CHALLENGE_ARCHIVED`.
- Add storage keys in `constants.ts`: `STORAGE_KEYS.TRANSACTIONS` and `STORAGE_KEYS.CHECKPOINTS`.
- Consider adding lightweight persisted checkpoints that store derived `DailyStats` up to a checkpoint date to avoid full replay on startup.

Migration steps — Ledger (transaction log)
1. Define `Transaction` model and storage keys
   - Create `types.Transaction` union and `STORAGE_KEYS.TRANSACTIONS`, `STORAGE_KEYS.CHECKPOINTS`.
2. Implement storage helpers
   - `utils/transactionStore.ts` to append and read transactions, with deduplication helpers for system-generated items (e.g. `DAILY_BUDGET` per date).
3. Build replay engine
   - Implement `utils/replayEngine.ts` with:
     - `replay(transactions, fromCheckpoint?)` => produces derived `settings`, `entries`, and materialized per-date `DailyStats` up to a desired date.
     - Checkpointing support: persist snapshot state and last-applied transaction index to accelerate startup.
4. Deterministic daily-budget creation
   - When materializing a date, if no `DAILY_BUDGET` tx exists for that date, create and append one using the effective settings as of that date (derived by replaying `SETTINGS_UPDATED` transactions up to that date).
   - Ensure idempotency and deduplication (append only once).
5. Migration
   - Generate transactions representing existing `entries` and `settings` history: create `ENTRY_ADDED` transactions for existing entries (ordered by timestamp); create `DAILY_BUDGET` transactions for historical dates using current computed `statsMap` to preserve current historical values.
   - Create an initial checkpoint snapshot so the app can start from a compact state.
6. Update app code
   - Replace direct `settings` writes in UI code with appends of `SETTINGS_UPDATED` transactions and update local derived `settings` via replay result for UI convenience.
   - Update `calculateStats` to be a wrapper over the replay/materializer.
7. Tests and verification
   - Tests for replay determinism, idempotency, migration correctness, and preserving historical budgets after settings edits.
8. Rollout considerations
   - Because this is a larger change, ship with a migration path, backups, and an initial checkpoint creation step to minimize startup cost.

Operational details

- Checkpointing strategy (both options)
  - Periodically (e.g., daily or after N transactions), persist a checkpoint that stores snapshots up to a date and the last transaction index processed. This avoids full replay on each start.
- Storage format
  - Keep snapshots and transactions as JSON in `localStorage`. Use compact keys and consider compressing older checkpoints if size becomes a concern.
- Performance
  - Avoid replaying entire history on every UI render; replay once at startup or when transactions change, persist derived `settings` and `statsMap` into memory, and update incrementally as new transactions append.

Testing matrix

- Migration test: fresh install vs upgrade from previous version; verify historical values are preserved after migration.
- Regression tests: budgets unchanged for past dates after settings edits.
- Challenge tests: verify archived challenge `finalSaved`/`finalTotalBudget` are based on applied historical budgets.

Estimated effort

- Option A (per-day snapshots): 4–8 developer-hours (types, storage helpers, `calculateStats` edits, migration, tests).
- Option B (transaction log + checkpoints): 1–3 developer-days (design, types, replay engine, migration, UI integration, tests).

Risks & mitigation

- Risk: localStorage growth — mitigate via checkpointing and retention policy for old transactions/snapshots.
- Risk: migration runtime on first run — mitigate by performing migration incrementally with progress indicator or limiting to a reasonable history window.
- Risk: subtle differences between computed historical budgets and replayed/serialized ones — mitigate by validating before finalizing migration and preserving original computed values when seeding snapshots/transactions.

Recommended next steps
1. Proceed with the ledger approach: design `Transaction` types, implement `transactionStore` and `replayEngine`, and write a migration that seeds transactions and creates an initial checkpoint.
2. Implement the replay engine and transaction append helpers, then seed transactions for existing `entries` and historical `DAILY_BUDGET` items using the current computed `statsMap` to preserve history.
3. Add tests for replay determinism and migration correctness, then stage rollout with backups and a migration flag.
